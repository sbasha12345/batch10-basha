WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGE IS PYTHON
-->object oriented programming language
-->dynamically typed language
-->scripting language
-->interpreted language
-->compiled language
-->funtional programming language

BARGAINED CHARACTER


print has 5 parameters
# object -->the value to be printed is object
# sep--> seperator
# Eg
# a = 8
# b = 9
# c = 89
1
# print(a, b,c, sep='$')
# end --> which is used to add the string at the end of the value,
# # It will not keep the command to stay in same line
# Eg:
# print(str(a), b, end='%%')
# print(str(c))

FLAVOURS OF PYTHON:-

>Cpython - Written in C, Most common Implementation of python.
>Jython - Java implementation of Python.
>IronPython - implementation of the Python programming language which is tightly integrated with .NET
>Brython - Browser Python, runs in browsers
>A RubyPython - Bridge between Python and Ruby Interpreters
>MicroPython - Runs in Micro Controllers

1).Commenting is used for making documentation in a python file.
2).When the line is commented , that line will not be considered as a part of the code.
3).When the program is exucuted, commented line will not be in the part of execution.

------> NOTE
Single line commenting can be done using #
'''
#print("hello world")
#print("hello world")
#import this
#print(this)


# import is a keybord which is used to communicated between the python files.
